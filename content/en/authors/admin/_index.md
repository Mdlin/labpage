Nobuyuki Umetani is an associate professor in the University of Tokyo. 
His research interests include computational fabrication, physics-based animation, machine learning for 3D geometry, 
data-driven physics modeling, and biomechanical simulation.

In the field of computer graphics, I have been conducting studies about interactive design systems for various functional objects 
such as clothing pattern design, furniture design, musical instrument design, and aerodynamical automobile design.
The main focus on my resarch is design of computational alrogithm and interaction technique to facilitate creative customized design.
