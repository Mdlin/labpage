By only moving a small portion of material points, the Eulerian‐on‐Lagrangian (EoL) method already shows great adaptivity to handle sharp contact, but it is still far from enough to reproduce rich and complex geometry details arising in simulations. In this paper, we extend the discrete configuration space by unifying all Lagrangian and EoL nodes in representation for even more adaptivity with every sample being assigned with a dynamic material coordinate. However, this great extension will immediately bring in much more redundancy in the dynamic system. Therefore, we propose additional energy to control the spatial distribution of all material points, seeking to equally space them with respect to a curvature‐based density field as a monitor. This flexible approach can effectively constrain the motion of material points to resolve numerical degeneracy, while simultaneously enables them to notably slide inside the parametric domain to account for the shape parameterization. Besides, to accurately respond to sharp contact, our method can also insert or remove nodes online and adjust the energy stiffness to suppress possible jittering artifacts that could be excited in a stiff system. As a result of this hybrid rh‐adaption, our proposed method is capable of reproducing many realistic rod dynamics, such as excessive bending, twisting and knotting while only using a limited number of elements.","tags":["Physics Simulation"],"title":"A Curvature and Density‐based Generative Representation of Shapes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Larsson","Hironori Yoshida","Nobuyuki Umetani","Takeo Igarashi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603152000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603152000,"objectID":"dcc1ea427ab1299fa90b54e426e8eb07","permalink":"https://cgenglab.github.io/labpage/en/publication/uist20_tsugite/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/labpage/en/publication/uist20_tsugite/","section":"publication","summary":"We present Tsugite—an interactive system for designing and fabricating wood joints for frame structures. To design and manually craft such joints is difficult and time consuming. Our system facilitates the creation of custom joints by a modeling interface combined with computer numerical control (CNC) fabrication. The design space is a 3D grid of voxels that enables efficient geometrical analysis and combinatorial search. The interface has two modes\":\" manual editing and gallery. In the manual editing mode, the user edits a joint while receiving real-time graphical feedback and suggestions provided based on performance metrics including slidability, fabricability, and durability with regard to the direction of fiber. In the gallery mode, the user views and selects feasible joints that have been pre-calculated. When a joint design is finalized, it can be manufactured with a 3-axis CNC milling machine using a specialized path planning algorithm that ensures joint assemblability by corner rounding. This system was evaluated via a user study and by designing and fabricating joint samples and functional furniture.","tags":["Computational Fabrication","Interactive Modeling"],"title":"Tsugite: Interactive Design and Fabrication of Wood Joints","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zi Ye","Nobuyuki Umetani","Takeo Igarashi","Tim Hoffmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1599264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599264000,"objectID":"c601857006f74fcf723e490e809a40b1","permalink":"https://cgenglab.github.io/labpage/en/publication/cgf20_curvature/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/labpage/en/publication/cgf20_curvature/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper introduces a generative model for 3D surfaces based on a representation of shapes with mean curvature and metric, which are invariant under rigid transformation. Hence, compared with existing 3D machine learning frameworks, our model substantially reduces the influence of translation and rotation. In addition, the local structure of shapes will be more precisely captured, since the curvature is explicitly encoded in our model. Specifically, every surface is first conformally mapped to a canonical domain, such as a unit disk or a unit sphere. Then, it is represented by two functions\":\" the mean curvature half‐density and the vertex density, over this canonical domain. Assuming that input shapes follow a certain distribution in a latent space, we use the variational autoencoder to learn the latent space representation. After the learning, we can generate variations of shapes by randomly sampling the distribution in the latent space. Surfaces with triangular meshes can be reconstructed from the generated data by applying isotropic remeshing and spin transformation, which is given by Dirac equation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on datasets of man‐made and biological shapes and compare the results with other methods.","tags":["Machine Learning","Geometry Processing"],"title":"A Curvature and Density‐based Generative Representation of Shapes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nobuyuki Umetani","Bernd Bickel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"66010409be6668c2473e91cc9ef26abc","permalink":"https://cgenglab.github.io/labpage/en/publication/sigg18_mlcfd/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/labpage/en/publication/sigg18_mlcfd/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
